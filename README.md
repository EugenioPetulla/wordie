# Wordie!

## What is this?

A really nice and useful (at least for me and some other folks) Chrome extension that lets you translate a word, using wordreference, with a simple shortcut (Alt + W).

You can also choose a default languages combination, to customize it for your needs.

## Installation

* `git clone` this repo;
* `cd` into the folder;
* `npm install` to install dependencies;
* `./make` to create a `bin` folder with the unpacked version of the extension to test it in Chrome;

## Can I Suggest a New Language?

Sure! Just open a pull request, and take a look into the `_locales` folder. You'll find everything there.
